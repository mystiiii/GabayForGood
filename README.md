* **Project Status:** This is a finals project that remains in a "work in progress" state. It contains unfinished debugging and logic that was part of the iterative learning process.
* **Database Connectivity:** The application was originally configured to interface with a specific institutional SQL Server database via SQL Authentication. For security and privacy, these connection strings have been commented out or restricted.
* **Non-Public Use:** Due to the dependency on private school infrastructure, the project is not intended for public deployment or local execution without significant reconfiguration of the data layer.
